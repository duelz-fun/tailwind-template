# TailwindCSS Template

This project is meant to be used as a TailwindCSS template with the most basic functionality in place to build and run locally your app.

Minimal template for TailwindCSS project

* Tailwind
* AutoPrefixer
* PostCSS-cli
* Local-Web-Server

## How to work
The folder `public` contains all the files that will be published, and the folder `/css` constains the file tailwind.css that can be updated to add any extra style required

## How to build
To just build our TailwindCSS file we can execute the following script: `npm run tailwind`


## How to run
Execute `npm run dev` to start the CSS processor in watch mode

In another window/tab you can run `npm start` to serve using **Local-Web-Server** and since the watch mode is updated, any change done in tailwind.css will be pick.
